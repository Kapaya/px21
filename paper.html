<p class="author">By Kapaya Katongo, <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/">Geoffrey Litt</a> and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/">Daniel Jackson</a></p>
<p class="date">This paper will be submitted to the <a href="https://2021.programming-conference.org/home/px-2021">PX/21</a> workshop. Also available in a <a href="paper.pdf">PDF version</a>.</p>

<p>Websites are malleable: users can install browser extensions and run arbitrary Javascript in the developer console to change them. However, this malleability is only accessible to programmers with knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and the DOM. To broaden access to customization, our prior work developed an approach that empowers end-users to customize websites without traditional programming via a browser extension called Wildcard.</p>
<p>Wildcard’s customizations are powered by web scraping code which is currently written in Javascript by programmers. This means that end-users can only customize a website if a programmer has written web scraping code for it. Furthermore, end-users do not have the ability to extend web scraping code in order to perform new customizations or repair web scraping code to fix broken customizations.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present our progress towards extending Wildcard to empower end-users to create, extend and repair web scraping code for customization by demonstration. We have successfully used our system to create web scraping code on a variety of websites and discuss three design principles that can be applied to the broader field of end-user web scraping.</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="sec:introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Many websites on the internet do not meet the exact needs of all of their users. End-user web customization systems like Chickenfoot <span class="citation" data-cites="bolin2005">[<a href="#ref-bolin2005" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>, Sifter <span class="citation" data-cites="huynh2006">[<a href="#ref-huynh2006" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>, Thresher <span class="citation" data-cites="hogue2005">[<a href="#ref-hogue2005" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span> and Vegemite <span class="citation" data-cites="lin2009">[<a href="#ref-lin2009" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span> help users tweak and adapt websites to fit their unique requirements, ranging from reorganizing or annotating content on the website to automating common tasks. In our prior work, have presented Wildcard <span class="citation" data-cites="litt2020a">[<a href="#ref-litt2020a" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>, a customization system which augments websites with a table view that shows their underlying structured data. The table is bidirectionally synchronized with the original website, so end users can easily customize the website by interacting with the table, including sorting and filtering data, adding annotations, and running computations in a spreadsheet formula language.</p>
<p>This prior work has a key limitation. In order to enable end-users to customize a website with Wildcard, a Javascript programmer first needs to code an adapter that specifies how to scrape the website content and set up a bidirectional synchronization with the table view. Even though we provide a shared repository of adapters, this means that an end-user can only use Wildcard with popular websites that some programmer has already written an adapter for. Additionally, if an adapter doesn’t scrape the desired data, or stops functioning correctly when a website changes, an end-user has no recourse to extend or repair it on their own. Furthermore, even for programmers, writing correct scraping code for adapters is a nontrivial task.</p>
<p>In this paper, we describe an addition to Wildcard: a system that enables end-users to create website adapters by demonstration within the browser. Using this scraping system, a user can now perform end-to-end web customizations using Wildcard on arbitrary websites in a spreadsheet paradigm, without ever needing to code an adapter. Furthermore, users can also extend or repair existing adapters made by others. In combination, these capabilities vastly expand the range of websites that users can customize using Wildcard.</p>
<p>Existing web scraping systems that utilize demonstrations [FlashExtract, Rousillon, import.io] provide some of the features we desire but are targeted at the task of data extraction. Wildcard’s needs consist of data extraction and bidirectional synchronization between the DOM of a website and the table through which customizations are made.</p>
<p>The contributions of this paper are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through a series of examples, we show that users can utilize our system to successfully create Wildcard adapters on a variety of websites via demonstration (Section 2)</li>
<li>We describe key aspects of the system’s implementation and how web scraping for customization is different from web scraping for extraction. We describe the algorithms we use to generalize from a small set of user demonstrations to the entire set of available data. (Section 3)</li>
<li>We share three design principles underlying our system that apply not only to the domain of web customization, but offer general insights for web scraping and programming by demonstration. We describe the importance of live programming in the web scraping domain. We also discuss the idea of <em>editing by demonstration</em>: enabling end users to not only create new programs by demonstration, but also to extend and repair existing programs by performing partial demonstrations (Section 4)</li>
<li>We share our broader vision for web scraping for customization, with a focus on how Wildcard’s spreadsheet-like formula language can be harnessed for customization during the web scraping process (Section 6)</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="sec:demos"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Motivating Examples</h1>
<p>In this section, we provide examples of how end users can use our system to create, extend and repair adapters for Wildcard.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="creating-a-simple-scraper"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Creating a simple scraper</h2>
<p>Jane wants to customize her experience on Weather.com by sorting the ten-day forecast based on the description of the weather on each day. This will let her quickly find the sunny days and allow her to plan when to go for an outdoor run. Previously, she would not be able to use Wildcard to perform this customization if a programmer had not written an adapter for weather.com. Using our tool, Jane can create an adapter by demonstration to support her customization.</p>
<p>Jane starts the process by clicking a menu item within the page, and hovering over a data value she might like to scrape:</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.1.1.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<p>The interface provides instant feedback as Jane hovers.</p>
<p>The selected row of data is annotated in the page with a border, to indicate that she will be demonstrating values from within that row. - The selected column of data is highlighted in the page with a green background, to show how the system has generalized her demonstration across all the rows in the data. - A table view appears at the bottom of the screen, and displays how the values will appear in the data table.</p>
<p>Jane tries hovering over several other elements in the page, considering the live feedback to decide what data would be useful. After considering several options, she decides to save the date field in the first column of the table, and commits the action by clicking.</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.1.2.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<p>Next, she performs a similar process to fill the next column with the weather descriptions. (After filling both columns, she also tries hovering over previously scraped data, and the toolbar at the top of the page indicates which column corresponds to the previously scraped data.) Finally, she ends the web scraping process and sorts the forecast by the weather description column using the Wildcard table:</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.1.3.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<p><em>todo comment: I would shorten the video above, the hovering feels unnecessary</em></p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="providing-multiple-demonstrations"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Providing multiple demonstrations</h2>
<p>John wants to sort a list of researchers on the MIT CSAIL website, to group researchers with the same research interests. As above, he initiates the web scraping system to create an adapter.</p>
<p>He starts by clicking on the name “Hal Abelson” to scrape the names of the researchers. However, he immediately notices a problem: the third researcher on the page, Anant Agarwal, does not have his name highlighted. The problem is also visible in the table view, which contains a blank cell.</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.2.1.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<p>This signals to John that the system has not successfully generalized from his single demonstration. To fix the issue, he returns back to column A and clicks on the name in the page that is missing the expected highlighting:</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.2.2.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<p>This provides a second demonstration to the system for how to scrape the column of data. In addition to repairing that single case, the system can also generalize from the second example to work more accurately on the rest of the rows.</p>
<p>Now that column A contains the expected data, John switches back to column B and proceeds to demonstrate the rest of the desired data. He can then sort the list of principal researchers by the descriptions of their research interests.</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.2.3.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="extending-web-scraping-code"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Extending Web Scraping Code</h2>
<p>End users can also extend adapters that they did not originally create.</p>
<p>Alice has been customizing her experience on timeanddate.com using Wildcard and a site adapter built by someone else. By sorting column C in the table, she is able to see a list of holidays sorted by the day of the week, so she can plan Friday trips with her friends.</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.3.1.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<p>Alice realizes that it would also be useful to sort the list by the type of holiday; for example, this would let her view the federal holidays together. However, the site adapter does not expose this data field in the table. Previously Alice would have needed to find a programmer to help her edit JavaScript code, but using our tool, Alice can extend the adapter immediately in the context of the page.</p>
<p>She clicks the “Edit Scraper” button to initiate the scraper editing process. As she hovers over the currently scraped values, the columns they belong to are highlighted. Finally, she clicks on “Federal Holiday” to add the new column of data and saves the changes. Alice then proceeds to sort the list by the type of holiday without having sought the assistance of a programmer.</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.3.2.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="repairing-web-scraping-code"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Repairing Web Scraping Code</h2>
<p>Here we showcase how an end-user called Bob can repair an adapter that he did not create in order to fix a customization that is no longer working because the website changed.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.4.1" id="scholar.google.com"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> scholar.google.com</h3>
<p>Bob uses Wildcard to customize his experience on scholar.google.com/citations which supports sorting publications by their citation count and the year that they were released in but not by their title. Wildcard’s sorting customization allows him to easily sort publications by their title which he finds very useful when looking for a publication of an author that he only knows by title.</p>
<video controls="controls" muted="muted" src="media/2.4.1.mp4" muted playsinline controls class>
</video>
<p>Unfortunately for Bob, the customization has not been working since scholar.google.com/citations got a minor redesign as seen by the missing data in column A of the table. Without our system, Bob would have to reach out to the programmer who wrote the web scraping code for the website in order for them to fix it and get his customization working again. Using our system, Bob can fix the web scraping code himself.</p>
<p>He initiates the editing process and is guided to the row that he needs to interact with by the green outline. He hovers over the desired value to demonstrate the column he wants to scrape but notices that the values will be populated into column D and not A where it was. Bob makes column A the active column, commits his scraping action and sees the publication titles populated into column A of the table. Bob saves and proceeds to re-apply his customization to the website by sorting the publications by their title, all without having sought the assistance of a programmer.</p>

<h1 data-number="3" id="sec:implementation"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> System Implementation</h1>
<p>We implemented our end-user web scraping system as an addition to the Wildcard browser extension. Below, we describe what makes web scraping for customization different from web scraping for extraction. We also describe our implementations of row and column generalization, live programming and editing by demonstration. Finally, we discuss some of the current limitations of our system.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="web-scraping-for-customization"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Web Scraping For Customization</h2>
<p>When a user scrapes by demonstration, the output of our system is a configuration object called a DOM scraping adapter which, among other things, specifies how to find the DOM element for each row and column in the table. The DOM elements are used to extract data from the website but also to create a bidirectional synchronization between the DOM of the website and the table. For example, when a user sorts the table, the DOM elements that represent the table rows are moved around in the DOM to reflect the new sorted order. A sample DOM scraping adapter can be seen below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode typescript"><code class="sourceCode typescript"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>{</span>

<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Web scraping for extraction is different from web scraping for customization because its goal is to only find DOM elements for each row and column of the output table and not set up the bidirectional synchronization needed by Wildcard to enable customizations.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="generalization-algorithm"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Generalization Algorithm</h2>
<p>In order to generate reusable scrapers from user demonstrations, our system solves the <em>wrapper induction</em> task: generalizing from a small set of user-provided examples to a scraping specification that will work on other parts of the website, and on future versions of the website.</p>
<p>We take an approach similar to that used in other tools like Vegemite and Sifter:</p>
<ul>
<li>We generate a single <em>row selector</em> for the website: a CSS selector that returns a set of DOM elements corresponding to individual rows of the table.</li>
<li>For each column in the table, we generate a <em>column selector</em>, a CSS selector that returns the element containing the column value within that row.</li>
</ul>
<p>One important difference is that our algorithm only accepts row elements that have direct siblings with a similar structure. We describe this constraint later in this section and how it simplifies the wrapper induction and discuss the resulting limitations this puts on our system in a section that follows.</p>
<p>When a user first demonstrates a column value, the generalization algorithm is responsible for turning the demonstration into a selector that will correctly identify all the row elements in the website and a selector that will correctly identify the element that contains the column value within a row element. During subsequent demonstrations, the generalization algorithm uses the generated row selector to find the row element that contains the column value and generates a column selector which identifies the corresponding column element.</p>
<p>At a high level, the generalization algorithm’s challenge is to traverse far enough up in the DOM tree from the demonstrated element to find the element which corresponds to the row. We solve this using a heuristic; the basic intuition is to find a large set of elements with similar parallel structure. Consider the following sample DOM, which displays a truncated table of superheroes, with each row containing some nested structure:</p>

<p>The user performs a demonstration by clicking on the SPAN element containing “Tony Stark.” Our algorithm traverses upwards from the demonstrated element, considering each successive parent element as a potential candidate for the row element. For each parent element <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, the process is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>compute a selector <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> that when executed on <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> only returns the demonstrated element</li>
<li>for each sibling <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, execute <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> on <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and record whether the selector returned an element. Intuitively, if the selector returns an element, this suggests that the sibling <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> has some parallel structure to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span></li>
<li>compute <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>s</em></sub></span>, the number of sibling elements of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> for which <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> returned an element</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how the row-sibling constraint simplifies the problem: row candidates without siblings that return an element after <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> is executed on them have <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>s</em></sub></span> = 0, thus disqualifying them. Furthermore, a candidate element <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is only accepted as the row element if the row selector associated with it only matches itself and elements that are its direct siblings.</p>
<p>From the parent of the initial SPAN element, the algorithm moves up the DOM tree until it reaches the BODY element. Then, it generates a selector for each <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> and discards any <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> with a selector that matches elements that are either not itself or a direct sibling. Finally, the algorithm picks an <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> with the largest, positive <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>s</em></sub></span>, preferring nodes lower in the tree as a tiebreaker. <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> is used as the selector for the column.</p>
<p>In the example DOM scenario, the first parent element is the DIV with class <code>names</code> when the user clicks on the SPAN element containing “Tony Stark.” This DIV has a sibling SPAN element, but the sibling doesn’t return an element when <code>.super_hero</code>, the selector that identifies the initial SPAN in the DIV, is executed on it. As a result, it has <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>s</em></sub></span> = 0. At the level above that, we consider the DIV with class <code>avenger</code>, which has at least one sibling that returns an element when the selector <code>.super_hero</code> is executed on it. Finally, the level above that once again has no siblings that return an element when the selector <code>.super_hero</code> is executed on them. Therefore, our algorithm returns the DIV element and outputs <code>avenger</code> as the row selector and <code>super_hero</code> as the column selector. These selectors are used to generate a DOM scraping adapter which returns the DOM elements corresponding to a superhero data row in the table.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="live-programming"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Live Programming</h2>
<p>Live programming is implemented by continually running the generalization algorithm on the DOM element under the user’s cursor, reverting if the user hovers away and committing when the user clicks. The generated row and column selectors are used to highlight all the matching elements on the website and create a DOM scraping adapter. Highlighting all the matching column elements on the website provides visual feedback about the system’s generalization to the user. Creating a DOM scraping adapter enables the system to populate the table augmentation and set up the bidirectional synchronization. Because the table is populated and the bidirectional synchronization is set up, users can customize as they scrape which provides a unified interaction model for customizing and scraping.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="editing-by-demonstration"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Editing By Demonstration</h2>
<p>The implementation of the editing by demonstration feature is rather simple. Because users interact with the scraped data directly in the context of the website, it is easy to re-initiate the scraping system. As shown in the DOM scraping adapter sample above, our system generates DOM scraping adapters with metadata that can be used to boot it up. The metadata simply consists of the row selector and the column selectors. Our generalization algorithm takes the provided row selector and uses it to generate new column selectors. We are keen to explore what other implementations of programming by demonstration this can be done for and what the implications and benefits would be.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5" id="limitations"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Limitations</h2>
<p>The row-sibling constraint we mentioned earlier is important for the end goal of customization because row elements that are not direct siblings may not represent data on the website that should be related as part of the same table by customizations such as sorting and filtering. Take the following truncated DOM structure showing two tables of superheros (Team Iron Man and Team Captain America):</p>

<p>Without the constraint that row elements have to be direct siblings, the row generalization algorithm could determine the row selector to be <code>.avenger</code> because it matches the most number of parallel structures (<span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>s</em></sub></span>). While this may be the correct result for the task of extraction, it is not for the task of customization. The selector matches all rows across the two tables so the sorting and filtering customizations could place rows in the incorrect table and thereby distort what the tables represent. Because of this, our system currently does not support generalizing over such DOM structures but we plan to explore the possibility of extracting multiple tables from a website and joining them.</p>
<p>Another DOM structure that our system cannot currently generalize over is one in which column elements are not contained within a row element that is a direct sibling of all the other row elements. Take the following truncated DOM structure showing a table of superheros:</p>

<p>The DOM structure contains one table of data in which rows are made up of an H1 tag (super hero name) and a SPAN tag (real name). For the task of extraction, the DOM elements can be scraped using the shown classes to output a table in which the values of the H1 tags form the first column and the values of the SPAN tag form the second column. For the task of customization, our system would need to know what the row boundaries are in order for customizations such as sorting to not distort the representation of the website. This can be done in DOM scraping adapters written by a programmer by creating artificial row boundaries. In the above DOM structure, an artificial row boundary could be created by representing a row as an H1 tag and the SPAN tag that immediately follows it. These artificial rows would form a single unit which would not distort the website after a sorting or filtering customization. We plan to explore how artificial row boundaries can be created via demonstration in order to support such DOM structures which are not uncommon (HackerNews has this type of DOM structure).</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="sec:design-principles"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Design Principles</h1>
<p>Below, we discuss the design principles underlying our work.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="live-programming-1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Live Programming</h2>
<p>In some systems like Rousillon for web scraping via demonstration, users only get full feedback about the program’s execution (generalization and the scraped values) after providing all the demonstrations. This means they cannot adjust their demonstrations in response to the system’s feedback as they demonstrate.</p>
<p>Our end-user web scraping system employs live programming techniques to eliminate this edit-compile-debug cycle by running the generalization algorithm and generating a DOM scraping adapter after each user demonstration. As we show in Section 2, when a user demonstrates a value of a column they wish to scrape, our system immediately shows how it has generalized the user’s demonstration across the other rows of the data by highlighting the all relevant values. It also populates the table with the scraped data based on the latest demonstration. The highlighting and table population serve to give users a view of how their demonstration has been generalized and what data will be available in the table once scraped.</p>
<p>This live programming approach is similar to that of FlashExtract <span class="citation" data-cites="le2014">[<a href="#ref-le2014" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>, a framework for data extraction by examples, and relates to the idea that an important quality of end-user programming is “interaction with a living system.” The authors describe how hugely successful end-user programming systems such as spreadsheets and SQL provide users immediate results after entering commands. Unlike text-based commands which are only valid when complete (e.g “SELECT * FRO” vs “SELECT * FROM user_table”), the target of demonstration commands (value of DOM element under the cursor) is the same during both hover and click (incomplete command vs complete command). This allows us to take a small step further by executing a command before a user completes it, thereby providing them with a preview of the results on hover.</p>
<p>There are limits to this approach. Providing live feedback on websites with a large number of DOM elements or complex CSS selectors can slow down the generalization process, especially if a user is constantly moving their cursor. Furthermore, many datasets are too large to entirely preview in the table; the user might benefit more from the live feedback if it could summarize large datasets. For example, FlashExtract provides a summary of its generalization through a color-coded minimap next to the scrollbar of its extraction interface.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="editing-by-demonstration-1"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Editing By Demonstration</h2>
<p>Many end-user web scraping and macro systems allow users to create programs by demonstration but do not offer a way to edit them by demonstration. In Rousillon, a web scraping program created by demonstration can only be edited through a high-level, block-based programming language. In Vegemite, an automation program created through demonstration can only be edited by editing the text-based representation of the program. This lack of a demonstration-based mechanism for editing is the case in other systems.</p>
<p>Providing an easy way for users to edit programs is fundamental to fully democratizing web customization. If a website’s scraping adapter ceases to function because the website changes, the table may lose its data which means that an end-user’s customizations may also cease to function. Furthermore, end-users are powerless to extend the scraping adapter to add columns to the table in order to perform new customizations.</p>
<p>Editing by demonstration promises to make end-users first-class citizens in the customization ecosystem. Because users interact with the scraped data directly in the context of the website, it is easy to re-initiate the scraping system. The edit process simply boots up the scraping system using metadata stored with the scraping adapter to the state when the demonstration was completed. Users that have gone through the creation process will immediately realize what to do in order to extend or repair the adapter. Users that have not gone through the creation process might have a harder time but we provide visual clues (such as highlighting the row to perform demonstrations from with a green border) and live programming (immediately preview the results of demonstrations) that serve as guides.</p>
<p>Editing by demonstration in the web scraping domain is feasible because the programs that scrape column values are independent of each other: changing the program that scrapes values into column A has no effect on the program that scrapes values in column B. However, changing the program that retrieves rows would affect the programs that scrape values into columns because they are dependent on the values being available in a row. This is therefore not supported but is an acceptable limitation for us given our focus on extension and repair which only deal with programs that scrape column values.</p>
<p>This design principle is related to the idea of “in-place toolchains” being an integral part of end-user programming systems. The authors champion the practice of end-user programming systems allowing users to edit programs “using an interface and set of abstractions that is as close as possible to the ones they use for their regular daily work.”</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="unified-interaction-model"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Unified Interaction Model</h2>
<p>In the previous iteration of Wildcard, web scraping was an entirely separate activity from customization. Programmers that wrote scraping adapters would need to switch into an IDE to write code as part of customizing a new website, making it a much less unified interaction model.</p>
<p>The same problem appears in many other tools. For example, in a typical web scraping workflow, scraper creation is treated as a specialized step, distinct from other stages of work. The scraped data is exported to a database or a spreadsheet for further processing; if the user comes across an omission or a problem while working with the data, they need to switch contexts to edit the scraping logic. The problem also emerges in web customization tools more similar to Wildcard, like Vegemite, which has separate steps for selecting and augmenting data. In a user study of Vegemite, participants reported that “it was confusing to use one technique to create the initial table, and another technique to add information to a new column.’”</p>
<p>In this work, we have combined scraping and customization into a more unified activity within a single system. The goal is to minimize the context switch between <em>extracting</em> the data and <em>using</em> the data. A user might start out by scraping some data, and then switch to customizing the website using the results. Then, they might realize they need more data to perform their desired task, at which point they can easily augment the adapter by demonstrating new columns. All of these tasks take place right in the browser, where the user was initially already using the uncustomized website. Instead of bringing the data to another tool, we have brought a tool to the data.</p>
<p>Of course, there is value in specialized tools: Wildcard has nowhere near the full capabilities of spreadsheet software or databases. Nevertheless, we believe a unified interaction model for scraping and customization presents a significantly lower barrier to entry for customization.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="sec:related-work"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Related Work</h1>
<p>End-user web scraping for customization relates to existing work in end-user web scraping by a number of tools.</p>
<p>FlashExtract <span class="citation" data-cites="le2014">[<a href="#ref-le2014" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span> is a framework for data extraction by examples. Its interface provides immediate visual feedback about the generalization and scrapes the matched values in an output tab. In addition, the interface has a program viewer tab that contains a high level description of what the generated program is doing and provides a list of alternative programs. Finally, the interface has a disambiguation tab that utilizes conversational clarification to disambiguate programs, the conservations with the user serving as inputs to generate better programs. We plan to have implementations both the program viewer and disambiguation features of in future iterations of our system. Where we differentiate ourselves from FlashExtract is by setting up a bidirectional synchronization with the source of the data and the output table, a task that is necessary for customization.</p>
<p>Roussillon <span class="citation" data-cites="chasins2018">[<a href="#ref-chasins2018" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span> is a tool that enables end-users to scrape distributed, hierarchical web data. Its interface does not provide complete live feedback about its generalizations or the values to be scrapped until all the demonstrations have been provided and the generated program has been run. If run on a website it has encountered before, Roussillon makes all the previously determined generalizations visible to the user by color-coding the values on the website that belong to the same column. This is certainly worth considering for our system as users will not have to actively explore in order to discover which values are available for scraping and how they are related to each other. On the extension and repair front, Roussillon presents the web scraping code generated by demonstration as an editable, high-level, block-based language called Helena. While Helena can be used to perform more complex editing tasks, it presents a change in the model used for creation. Our system maintains the model used for creation by allowing users to extend and repair web scraping code via demonstration.</p>
<p>Vegemite <span class="citation" data-cites="lin2009">[<a href="#ref-lin2009" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span> is a tool for end-user programming of mashups. It has two interfaces: one for scraping values from a website and another for creating scripts that operate on the scraped values. The web scraping interface does not provide live feedback about the generalization on hover but after a user clicks, the interface shows the result of the system’s generalization by highlighting the all matched values. Furthermore, even though the interface also has a table, the table is only populated with the scraped values after all the demonstrations have been provided. The scripting interface utilizes CoScripter and is used to record operations on the scraped values for automation. For example, the scripting interface can be used to demonstrate the task of copying an address in the table, pasting it into a walk score calculator and pasting the result back into the table. The script would be generalized to all the rows and re-run to fill in the remaining walk scores. CoScripter provides the generated automation program as text-based commands, such as “paste address into ‘Walk Score’ input,” which can be edited after the program is created via “sloppy programming” techniques. However, this editing does not extend to the web scraping interface used for demonstrations.</p>
<p>Sifter <span class="citation" data-cites="huynh2006">[<a href="#ref-huynh2006" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> is a tool that augments well structured websites with advanced sorting and filtering functionality. Like Wildcard, it uses web scraping to extract data from websites in order to enable customizations (sorting and filtering). It performs the web scraping automatically using a variety of heuristics and solicits guidance from the user if this fails. While automatic web scraping seems desirable, it is unclear how useful it is if the goal is customization. Given a row with ten scrapable values, and therefore ten columns, would a user prefer to simply demonstrate the value for the single column they are interested in or un-demonstrate the nine values they are not interested in? This is a question we can only answer after performing a user study.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="sec:conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion And Future Work</h1>
<p>In this paper, we presented our progress towards end-user web scraping for customization to empower end-users in Wildcard’s ecosystem to create, extend and repair web scraping code. There are several outstanding issues and open questions we hope to address in future work.</p>
<p>Like existing approaches, web scraping in our current implementation is limited to what can be demonstrated. This is problematic if users want to scrape the URL associated with a link, which is not visible, or only scrape a substring of a value. To solve this, we plan to harness Wildcard’s formula language. Motivated end-users will able to use formulas targeted at web scraping, for example <code>=GetAttribute(link_column, ‘href’)</code>, and formulas targeted at value processing, for example <code>=GetSubstring(amount_column, 1, 2)</code>, to scrape the URL associated with columns whose values are scraped from link elements and the substring of values associated with columns whose values are strings respectively. This will give end-users some of the power available to programmers that write web scraping code in Javascript which supports a wide variety of DOM access and processing ability.</p>
<p>To verify our design principles, we plan to carry out a broader evaluation of our system through a user study. Furthermore, we plan to incorporate the program viewer and disambiguation features available in FlashExtract to give users more insight and control into the generalization process as well as a more concrete alternative, than providing further demonstrations, to aid the generalization through disambiguation. One question we aim to ponder is whether formulas, which are in essence programs, are self-descriptive enough to not warrant paraphrasing in English as is the case with FlashExtract’s C# programs.</p>
<p>Our end goal is to empower end-users to customize websites with full control of the various aspects that are needed to enable the customizations. This in turn will help make the malleability of the web a reality for all of its users.</p>
